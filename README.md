reliving 1999 at !!Con 2021 by tinkering with a DIY napster

thanks for stopping by! This repo will be updated over the coming weeks with more bits and bobs.

## resources

- I would recommend [Beej's Guide to Network Programming](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/) to everyone with even a passing interest in network programming.
- The [WinMX Napster Specification](https://www.winmxworld.com/tutorials/ourmx_opennap_protocol.html) was priceless for looking up each of the Napster packets.
- The [OpenNap Specification](http://opennap.sourceforge.net/napster.txt) is what all of this is based on.
- The paper "[P2P Networks for Content Sharing](https://arxiv.org/ftp/cs/papers/0402/0402018.pdf)" gives a fantastic overview of both Napster and other P2P networks.
